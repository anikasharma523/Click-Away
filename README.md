A multi amenity booking web-app that makes the student-admin interaction efficient and less time consuming in different universities/colleges 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# WHY
In any educational institute, there are various administrative tasks which are time consuming and redundant. Various amenities like study rooms, gym, appointment with professors, going out of campus require students to book slots or approval of the admin beforehand, which in case done physically can cause a lot of crowd and mismanagement. This calls for a solution, like a software system to assist the students and the admin so that we spend more time being productive and focused on delivery rather than waiting for a verdict or a slot. The software will promote transparency of the process, makes the tasks of admin easier and simplifies cumbersome processes.

# Description
A multi-amenity booking web app that facilitates student-admin interaction in universities and colleges can significantly streamline booking amenities such as sports facilities, study rooms, event spaces, and other resources. With this web app, students can easily access available book resources, eliminating the need for lengthy manual booking procedures and long waiting times.

The web app can be designed to be user-friendly and accessible on multiple devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. Students can create accounts and log in to the system to access the booking platform and view available resources. They can then select the amenity they want to book and choose the date and time of their preference.

Administrators can use the web app to manage the amenities and approve or decline student bookings. They can also monitor the availability of different amenities, view upcoming bookings, and make changes to the schedule as needed. Additionally, the system can automatically notify students and admins about booking confirmations, cancellations, and changes.

By implementing a multi-amenity booking web app, universities, and colleges can reduce the workload of their administrative staff while also providing an efficient and easy-to-use platform for students. This would lead to a more streamlined booking process, saving time and resources for both students and administrators.

# Tech-Stack Used
he major technical decisions that we made while building the web-app were:

1. Frontend: 
- We used HTML, CSS and bootstrap. 
- We also used Jinja2 which is a dynamic templating language in python. Jinja2 allowed us to define templates, which are files that contain    placeholders for dynamic content. These placeholders can be filled with actual content at runtime, making our web-page dynamic. 

2. Backend: 
- Python- flask. Flask is a lightweight framework that doesn't have a lot of dependencies, which makes it easy to set up and use.
- For the database, we've used SQLite. SQLite requires minimal maintenance, as it is a self-contained database that does not require a separate server process.

# Run Locally
Use any IDE that supports python. SQLite should be installed. Run the project on the local host
